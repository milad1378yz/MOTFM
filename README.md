## Requirements

To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

**Important Note**:  
- Your training data **must** be stored in a single `.pkl` file, which itself must follow the structure below.  

Within that `.pkl` file, your data dictionary should look like:
```python
{
  "train": [  # List of training samples
    {
      "image": "Tensor[Channels, Height, Width, ...] (float32, normalized)",
      "mask":  "Tensor[1, Height, Width, ...] (int32)",
      "class": "Scalar integer (int32)",
      "metadata": "Structured data (dict or other format)"
    },
    ...
  ],

  "valid": [  # List of validation samples
    {
      "image": "Tensor[Channels, Height, Width, ...] (float32, normalized)",
      "mask":  "Tensor[1, Height, Width, ...] (int32)",
      "class": "Scalar integer (int32)",
      "metadata": "Structured data (dict or other format)"
    },
    ...
  ],

  "test": [  # List of test samples
    {
      "image": "Tensor[Channels, Height, Width, ...] (float32, normalized)",
      "mask":  "Tensor[1, Height, Width, ...] (int32)",
      "class": "Scalar integer (int32)",
      "metadata": "Structured data (dict or other format)"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Make sure your dataset adheres to the described data structure, saved in a single `.pkl` file, before running the training or inference pipelines.

## Configuration Files

You must **either create** or **modify** a YAML configuration file to suit your dataset paths, model parameters, and hyperparameters. Some sample configuration files are provided in the `configs/` folder. By default, `configs/default.yaml` is used if no custom path is provided.

---

## Training

To train the model, run:
```bash
python trainer.py --config_path configs/default.yaml
```

- `--config_path`: Path to your YAML configuration file. Defaults to `configs/default.yaml` if not provided.

**Note**: Make sure you have prepared your dataset (as a single `.pkl` file) and configuration file properly before starting training.

---

## Inference

To run inference with a trained model, use:
```bash
python inferer.py \
    --config_path configs/default.yaml \
    --num_samples 2000 \
    --model_path mask_class_conditioning_checkpoints/latest \
    --num_inference_steps 5
```

Below are explanations of the arguments:

- **`--config_path`** (str): Path to the configuration file. Defaults to `configs/default.yaml`.
- **`--num_samples`** (int): Number of samples to save. If you set it to `None`, all samples are saved. Defaults to `2000`.
- **`--model_path`** (str): Path to the model checkpoint to load. Defaults to `mask_class_conditioning_checkpoints/latest`.
- **`--num_inference_steps`** (int): Number of inference steps during sampling. Defaults to `5`.

**Note**: After inference, the script saves a `.pkl` file containing all generated samples in the same checkpoint folder (i.e., `mask_class_conditioning_checkpoints/latest` by default).
